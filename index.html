                <h4>What are the <strong>conditions for entering the territory</strong>?</h4>
            
                <p> Every country has it is own reglumentations to accept forgneirs in their territory.These reglimentation are based on many criteria, geography, diplomatic and politic. dependent on the traveller's nationality and passport it might be easier for him to go to some countries more than to others. To not have any surprise from this side, I suggest you to log on to the official government website of the country of destination ahead of time to know all the requierement you might need to access to that country</p>
                
                
                <h4>Do I need a passport?</h4>
                <p>Regardless of your country of destination, you must be in possession of your valid travel document.In the majority of the time, Passport is the only identity document valid worldwide. Though, there are exceptions. For example, if you are a citizen of a country of European union and you would like to travel inside the Schengen area, all you would need is your id.</p>
                <p> If you do not have a valid travel document, in some cases you can obtain an emergency passport or a laissez-passer that will allow you to travel</p>
                
                <h4>Do I need a visa?</h4>
                <p>Having a Canadian passport allows you to travel to many countries without visa. With it, you can visit 184 different countries. You will just be asked obtaining an electronic travel authorization (ETIAS). The request is made directly online. Once validated, it is sent by e-mail quickly. Pay attention to check the number of days you are authorized to stay in the territory. It can go from 90 days to less than 30 days. Regarding the countries requiring a visa, you can easily find the list on the internet.</p>

                <h4>Are there any particular vaccinations to do before leaving?</h4>
                <p>To travel abroad you must be vaccinated against Covid-19 <strong>(note: not all vaccines are valid)</strong>. Then, depending on your country of destination the <strong>compulsory vaccinations</strong> differ. The simplest is to speak to your doctor a few months before your departure in order to have time to do the necessary vaccines.Additionally, if travelling to equatorial, or African country.for example, you would better verify the required vaccinations on the health ministory website, because travelling to these countries might requiere you to have additional vaccinations for some deseases to which you are not vaccinated. example of malaria, yellow fever. 
                </p>
                
                <h4>Is travel insurance compulsory to enter the country?</h4>
                <p>If you are Canadian, there are only five countries that require the purchase of travel insurance to be able to enter its territory: <strong>China, Russia, Algeria, <strong>the Mongolia</strong> and Cuba</strong>. For all other countries it is only recommended to subscribe to one. If you ever need to consult a doctor during your trip or be hospitalized, your Canadian health insurance would not cover the costs. In order to avoid having to spend astronomical sums, it is wiser to plan your supported. Be as aware as the pandemic has changed things. Today,to go to about forty foreign countries it is mandatory to have an insurance that covers the costs of care related to Covid-19 if you ever fall sick. This service can be offered to you by your bank, with the insurance of your card bank or travel insurance.</p>
                
                <h4>Procedure for traveling with medication.</h4>
                <p> It is possible and even recommended to travel with your medication if you follow daily treatment. Some medicines are not available in all countries. It is therefore important to plan your treatment for a period longer than the duration of your trip in case your return is delayed. Don't forget to take with you your prescription in case of border control.</p>

                <h4>What are the customs or <strong>way of life</strong>? Is there a dress code to respect?</h4>
                <p>Some outfits may be prohibited in some countries. Get well informed before leaving: can I wear clothes that leave my shoulders uncovered? Can I discover my legs without shocking the population or going against certain laws? This advisable to be well prepared so as not to find yourself in delicate situations, sometimes even unintentionally.</p>

	<p>I visited <strong id="Plan">France</strong> several times, few years already. Paris, Marseille, Nice. Every city, every region has its own athmosphere and many things to see.</p>

	<p><strong id="Paris">Paris</strong>, the city of love, the capital of France. It is a very touristic city because of its reputation. However, it is not the city that I preferred to visit. The world-famous Eiffel Tower did not awaken the magic I had hoped for! If I had to give any advice, it would be to go to the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Montmartre and the Pantheon, which have magnificent architecture not to be missed.</p>

                
             
	<p class="clear"><strong id="Marseille">Marseille and Nice</strong> were my favourites. Two coastal towns in the South of France. We feel good there. The people are warm and their particular accent mixed with the song of the cicadas create a sweet summer melody. Heat and sun are there for a good part of the year. You can discover pretty historic buildings such as the Palais Longchamp or the Basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde. Boat trips and swimming in the warm waters of the <strong>Mediterranean</strong> are a must!</p>

    <p><strong id="Nantes">Nantes</strong> is an amazing city. Due to its architecture and the configuration of its streets, Nantes closely resembles the French capital. Besides, from many Parisians choose to leave their city to settle in Nantes. It's not by chance ! Recognized as one of the cities where life is good, this student city is always very lively. Street shows, festivals, concerts, exhibitions, nightlife... This that I particularly appreciated in this city is the island of machines. On the island Nantes offered by the Loire is a unique merry-go-round inspired by the novel "20000 leagues Under the Sea‚Äù by Jules Vernes. You can also see the elephant: the symbol of Nantes. An elephant 12 meters high made of steel and wood that moves. He can even carrier 50 passengers. It's an amazing mechanic!</p>
